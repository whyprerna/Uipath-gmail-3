This is an automation solution, known as “Automating Daily Job List Dispatch via 
Email,” based on the IOCL refinery’s requirement for efficient and accurate daily task 
management. The refinery needed a system to manage Gmail activities, including downloading 
attachments from unread emails, organizing them, and sending timely task notifications to 
employees.
